            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>A curious person, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) enthusiast, and a technology lover. In short, I am a programmer.
            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <h4>CTO & Co-Founder</h4>
            <p>Nebuly &middot; Full-time<br>Oct 2021 - Present &middot; 2 yrs 2 mos<br>
               As the CTO and Co-Founder of Nebuly, I've spearheaded numerous innovative projects, leading the company's strategic vision and driving technological advancement.</p>
            <h4>Machine Learning Engineer</h4>
            <p>L2F SA<br>Mar 2020 - Sep 2021 &middot; 1 yr 7 mos<br>Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland<br>
               At L2F SA, I worked on the entire AI development process. I turned ideas into workflows, built and trained machine learning and deep learning models, integrated them into the Giotto.ai platform backend as microservices, and deployed them in production on various cloud providers. I developed the AI component at the core of Giotto Compliance and the AI-powered brain of the Giotto.ai AutoML platform. I also constructed a computer vision system to remove clouds and shadows from drone images and a news detection algorithm for trend identification in healthcare.</p>
            <h4>Machine Learning Intern</h4>
            <p>Feb 2019 - Mar 2020 &middot; 1 yr 2 mos<br>Lausanne Area, Switzerland<br>
               As an intern, I developed a forecasting system to estimate containers at ports for one of the world's largest shipping companies using multivariance time series and LSTM algorithms. I also built a text synthesis algorithm to create summarizations from multiple articles for a Swiss insurance company, utilizing transformer models and LSTM algorithms.</p>
